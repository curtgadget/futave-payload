# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create RESTful API Endpoints
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop RESTful API endpoints to expose soccer data to client applications, implementing the necessary routes, controllers, and middleware.
# Details:
1. Design API routes for all data entities
2. Implement controllers for each route
3. Add authentication middleware
4. Implement pagination for large datasets
5. Add filtering and sorting capabilities
6. Implement rate limiting
7. Add error handling middleware
8. Create API documentation

Current Implementation Status (~65% complete):
- Team endpoints are production-ready with sophisticated features
- Authentication, error handling, and architectural patterns are solid
- Match detail endpoint works with real database integration
- League/player endpoints exist but use placeholder data fetchers
- Missing core endpoints: matches listing, countries, search
- Advanced features (Wave Detector, Memory Avenues) not started

```typescript
// api/matches.ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import payload from 'payload';
import { authenticateRequest } from '../middleware/auth';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  // Apply authentication middleware
  const authResult = await authenticateRequest(req, res);
  if (!authResult.success) return;
  
  try {
    switch (req.method) {
      case 'GET':
        // Parse query parameters
        const { page = 1, limit = 10, league, team, status } = req.query;
        
        // Build query
        const query: any = {};
        if (league) query.league = { equals: league };
        if (team) query['or'] = [
          { homeTeam: { equals: team } },
          { awayTeam: { equals: team } },
        ];
        if (status) query.status = { equals: status };
        
        // Execute query with pagination
        const matches = await payload.find({
          collection: 'matches',
          where: query,
          page: Number(page),
          limit: Number(limit),
          sort: '-startTime',
        });
        
        return res.status(200).json(matches);
        
      default:
        return res.status(405).json({ error: 'Method not allowed' });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API error:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
}
```

Create a comprehensive API route map document that outlines all endpoints, HTTP methods, required parameters, and expected responses. Define authentication requirements for each endpoint, specifying which routes require authentication and what permission levels are needed. Design JWT token structure and authentication flow.

Progress has been made with the initial API structure setup in the /src/app/api/v1 directory. The first endpoint for teams with various views has been implemented, and an authentication utility has been established in utilities/auth.js.

Remaining tasks include:
1. Complete the comprehensive API route map document covering all entities (leagues, teams, players, matches, countries, Wave Detector, Memory Avenues)
2. Finalize the JWT-based authentication flow design with special consideration for mobile client requirements
3. Define detailed parameter structures and standardized response formats for all endpoints
4. Document the relationships and dependencies between different entity endpoints
5. Ensure the authentication utility in utilities/auth.js properly integrates with all planned endpoints
6. Prepare for handoff to the Core Entity Controllers implementation team

<info added on 2025-05-04T03:15:59.843Z>
The comprehensive API route map has been successfully created and stored in `src/app/api/v1/documentation/api-route-map.md`. This document provides a complete specification of all API endpoints required for the application, including:

1. Core entity endpoints (teams, leagues, players, matches) with detailed HTTP methods, parameters, and response formats
2. Specialized feature endpoints for Wave Detector and Memory Avenues functionality
3. User preference management endpoints to handle personalization features
4. Reference data endpoints for supporting information like countries and other static data
5. Detailed request/response format examples in JSON
6. Implementation guidelines for maintaining consistency when adding new endpoints

The authentication approach has been standardized using the `createAuthMiddleware` function from `src/utilities/auth.ts`, with clear documentation on which endpoints require authentication and what permission levels are needed.

The next implementation phase will follow this sequence:
1. Leagues endpoint implementation (following the teams endpoint pattern)
2. Players endpoint implementation
3. Matches endpoint implementation
4. Specialized feature endpoints implementation

This API route map document will serve as the definitive reference for the Core Entity Controllers implementation team to ensure consistent API design across all endpoints.
