export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  // Apply authentication middleware
  const authResult = await authenticateRequest(req, res);
  if (!authResult.success) return;
  
  try {
    switch (req.method) {
      case 'GET':
        // Parse query parameters
        const { page = 1, limit = 10, league, team, status } = req.query;
        
        // Build query
        const query: any = {};
        if (league) query.league = { equals: league };
        if (team) query['or'] = [
          { homeTeam: { equals: team } },
          { awayTeam: { equals: team } },
        ];
        if (status) query.status = { equals: status };
        
        // Execute query with pagination
        const matches = await payload.find({
          collection: 'matches',
          where: query,
          page: Number(page),
          limit: Number(limit),
          sort: '-startTime',
        });
        
        return res.status(200).json(matches);
        
      default:
        return res.status(405).json({ error: 'Method not allowed' });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API error:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:

2. Verify authentication works correctly
3. Test pagination with large datasets
4. Verify filtering and sorting functionality
5. Test error handling with invalid requests
6. Verify rate limiting functionality
7. Test API performance under load

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Route Structure and Authentication Flow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the complete API route structure for all entities (leagues, teams, players, matches, countries, Wave Detector, Memory Avenues) and design the authentication flow for securing these endpoints.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive API route map document that outlines all endpoints, HTTP methods, required parameters, and expected responses. Define authentication requirements for each endpoint, specifying which routes require authentication and what permission levels are needed. Design JWT token structure and authentication flow.

Create a comprehensive API route map document that outlines all endpoints, HTTP methods, required parameters, and expected responses. Define authentication requirements for each endpoint, specifying which routes require authentication and what permission levels are needed. Design JWT token structure and authentication flow.

Progress has been made with the initial API structure setup in the /src/app/api/v1 directory. The first endpoint for teams with various views has been implemented, and an authentication utility has been established in utilities/auth.js.

Remaining tasks include:
1. Complete the comprehensive API route map document covering all entities (leagues, teams, players, matches, countries, Wave Detector, Memory Avenues)
2. Finalize the JWT-based authentication flow design with special consideration for mobile client requirements
3. Define detailed parameter structures and standardized response formats for all endpoints
4. Document the relationships and dependencies between different entity endpoints
5. Ensure the authentication utility in utilities/auth.js properly integrates with all planned endpoints
6. Prepare for handoff to the Core Entity Controllers implementation team

The comprehensive API route map has been successfully created and stored in `src/app/api/v1/documentation/api-route-map.md`. This document provides a complete specification of all API endpoints required for the application, including:

1. Core entity endpoints (teams, leagues, players, matches) with detailed HTTP methods, parameters, and response formats
2. Specialized feature endpoints for Wave Detector and Memory Avenues functionality
3. User preference management endpoints to handle personalization features
4. Reference data endpoints for supporting information like countries and other static data
5. Detailed request/response format examples in JSON
6. Implementation guidelines for maintaining consistency when adding new endpoints

The authentication approach has been standardized using the `createAuthMiddleware` function from `src/utilities/auth.ts`, with clear documentation on which endpoints require authentication and what permission levels are needed.

The next implementation phase will follow this sequence:
1. Leagues endpoint implementation (following the teams endpoint pattern)
2. Players endpoint implementation
3. Matches endpoint implementation
4. Specialized feature endpoints implementation

This API route map document will serve as the definitive reference for the Core Entity Controllers implementation team to ensure consistent API design across all endpoints.

## 2. Implement Core Entity Controllers (Teams, Leagues, Players) [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop controllers for the core entities including teams, leagues, and players with full CRUD operations where appropriate.
### Details:
Create separate controller files for each entity. Implement GET (list and detail), POST, PUT, and DELETE methods as needed. Include query parameter handling for filtering, sorting, and pagination. Ensure proper error handling and response formatting.
