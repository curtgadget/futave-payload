export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  // Apply authentication middleware
  const authResult = await authenticateRequest(req, res);
  if (!authResult.success) return;
  
  try {
    switch (req.method) {
      case 'GET':
        // Parse query parameters
        const { page = 1, limit = 10, league, team, status } = req.query;
        
        // Build query
        const query: any = {};
        if (league) query.league = { equals: league };
        if (team) query['or'] = [
          { homeTeam: { equals: team } },
          { awayTeam: { equals: team } },
        ];
        if (status) query.status = { equals: status };
        
        // Execute query with pagination
        const matches = await payload.find({
          collection: 'matches',
          where: query,
          page: Number(page),
          limit: Number(limit),
          sort: '-startTime',
        });
        
        return res.status(200).json(matches);
        
      default:
        return res.status(405).json({ error: 'Method not allowed' });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API error:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
}
```

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Route Structure and Authentication Flow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the complete API route structure for all entities (leagues, teams, players, matches, countries, Wave Detector, Memory Avenues) and design the authentication flow for securing these endpoints.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive API route map document that outlines all endpoints, HTTP methods, required parameters, and expected responses. Define authentication requirements for each endpoint, specifying which routes require authentication and what permission levels are needed. Design JWT token structure and authentication flow.

Create a comprehensive API route map document that outlines all endpoints, HTTP methods, required parameters, and expected responses. Define authentication requirements for each endpoint, specifying which routes require authentication and what permission levels are needed. Design JWT token structure and authentication flow.

Progress has been made with the initial API structure setup in the /src/app/api/v1 directory. The first endpoint for teams with various views has been implemented, and an authentication utility has been established in utilities/auth.js.

Remaining tasks include:
1. Complete the comprehensive API route map document covering all entities (leagues, teams, players, matches, countries, Wave Detector, Memory Avenues)
2. Finalize the JWT-based authentication flow design with special consideration for mobile client requirements
3. Define detailed parameter structures and standardized response formats for all endpoints
4. Document the relationships and dependencies between different entity endpoints
5. Ensure the authentication utility in utilities/auth.js properly integrates with all planned endpoints
6. Prepare for handoff to the Core Entity Controllers implementation team

The comprehensive API route map has been successfully created and stored in `src/app/api/v1/documentation/api-route-map.md`. This document provides a complete specification of all API endpoints required for the application, including:

1. Core entity endpoints (teams, leagues, players, matches) with detailed HTTP methods, parameters, and response formats
2. Specialized feature endpoints for Wave Detector and Memory Avenues functionality
3. User preference management endpoints to handle personalization features
4. Reference data endpoints for supporting information like countries and other static data
5. Detailed request/response format examples in JSON
6. Implementation guidelines for maintaining consistency when adding new endpoints

The authentication approach has been standardized using the `createAuthMiddleware` function from `src/utilities/auth.ts`, with clear documentation on which endpoints require authentication and what permission levels are needed.

The next implementation phase will follow this sequence:
1. Leagues endpoint implementation (following the teams endpoint pattern)
2. Players endpoint implementation
3. Matches endpoint implementation
4. Specialized feature endpoints implementation

This API route map document will serve as the definitive reference for the Core Entity Controllers implementation team to ensure consistent API design across all endpoints.

## 2. Implement Core Entity Controllers (Teams, Leagues, Players) [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop controllers for the core entities including teams, leagues, and players with full CRUD operations where appropriate.
### Details:
Create separate controller files for each entity. Implement GET (list and detail), POST, PUT, and DELETE methods as needed. Include query parameter handling for filtering, sorting, and pagination. Ensure proper error handling and response formatting.

Implementation completed for all core entity controllers following a consistent pattern:

1. League Endpoints Implementation:
   - Created src/app/api/v1/leagues.ts for individual league data with multiple views:
     * Overview view with basic league information
     * Standings view showing team rankings
     * Teams view listing participating teams
     * Seasons view showing historical seasons
   - Implemented src/app/api/v1/leaguesList.ts for listing leagues with filtering
   - Added TypeScript type definitions in src/app/api/v1/types/league.ts
   - Created service layer with src/app/api/v1/services/leagueDataFetcher.ts (placeholder implementation)

2. Player Endpoints Implementation:
   - Created src/app/api/v1/players.ts for individual player data with multiple views:
     * Overview view with basic player information
     * Stats view showing performance metrics
     * Career view showing historical team affiliations
   - Implemented src/app/api/v1/playersList.ts for listing players with filtering
   - Added TypeScript type definitions in src/app/api/v1/types/player.ts
   - Created service layer with src/app/api/v1/services/playerDataFetcher.ts (placeholder implementation)

3. Integration and Consistency:
   - Updated index.ts to register all new endpoints
   - Maintained consistent error handling patterns across all controllers
   - Implemented pagination for list endpoints
   - Applied authentication middleware consistently
   - Ensured query parameter handling for filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - Followed tab view pattern established in the Teams implementation

All controllers now provide appropriate CRUD operations and specialized views as specified in the API route documentation. The implementation uses placeholder functions for data fetching that would need to be connected to the actual database or external API in production.
