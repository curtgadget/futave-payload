# FutAve - Soccer Live Scores CMS

FutAve is a soccer live scores platform powered by Payload CMS that provides real-time match data, league information, team statistics, and standings.

## Overview

This repository contains the backend and content management system (CMS) for FutAve. It integrates with the Sportmonks API to sync soccer data and provides a robust API for multiple frontend clients.

### Key Features

- Real-time match data and live scores
- Comprehensive league and tournament information
- Team and player statistics
- League standings and team rankings
- Automated data synchronization with Sportmonks API
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend consumption

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js with Payload CMS
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Storage**: Payload Cloud
- **API Integration**: Sportmonks Soccer API
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Collections

The CMS is structured around the following main collections:

- **Leagues** - Soccer leagues and competitions
- **Matches** - Live and historical match data
- **Teams** - Team information, statistics, and standings
- **Players** - Player information and statistics
- **Coaches** - Coach information
- **Countries** - Country information for teams and leagues
- **MetadataTypes** - Supporting metadata for other collections
- **Media** - Images and media assets
- **Users** - CMS user management

## Data Synchronization

The system includes automated jobs for:
- Syncing league data
- Updating match information
- Maintaining team statistics and standings
- Syncing player information
- Syncing coach information
- Updating country data
- Managing metadata types

## API Endpoints

The CMS exposes RESTful endpoints for:
- Retrieving live match data
- Accessing league information
- Fetching team statistics and standings
- Accessing player information
- Managing media assets
Additionally, there are specific endpoints for managing data synchronization queues (e.g., `/api/queue-jobs/sync`, `/api/queue-jobs/preview`) and a versioned API (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) for broader data access.

## Environment Variables

Before running the application, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following required variables:

```env
# Required
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/futave
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-payload-secret-key-here
SPORTMONKS_API_KEY=your-sportmonks-api-key-here

# Optional (handled automatically by Next.js/deployment platforms)
NEXT_RUNTIME=nodejs
CI=false
FORCE_AUTH=true
```

### Variable Descriptions

- `DATABASE_URI` - MongoDB connection string. For local development with Docker: `mongodb://mongo:27017/futave`
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET` - A secure secret key for Payload CMS authentication and encryption
- `SPORTMONKS_API_KEY` - Your API key from [Sportmonks](https://sportmonks.com/) for fetching soccer data
- `NEXT_RUNTIME` - Next.js runtime environment (automatically set by Next.js)
- `CI` - Continuous Integration flag (automatically set by CI/CD platforms)
- `FORCE_AUTH` - Set to `true` to test API key authentication in development mode

## API Authentication

The API endpoints under `/api/v1/` require API key authentication in production.

### Setting up API Keys

1. **Access the admin panel**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin` (or your deployment URL)
2. **Create or edit a user**: Go to the Users collection
3. **Enable API Key**: Check the "Enable API Key" option in the user form
4. **Copy the generated key**: Payload will generate a unique API key for that user

### Using API Keys

Include the API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: API-Key your-generated-key-here" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/v1/leagues
```

### Development vs Production

- **Development mode**: API key authentication is bypassed by default (when `NODE_ENV=development`)
- **Test authentication locally**: Set `FORCE_AUTH=true` in your `.env` file to test API key authentication in development
- **Production**: API key authentication is always enforced

## Development

This backend system is designed to support multiple frontend clients (React Native, Next.js, etc.) while maintaining a single source of truth for soccer data.
