# FutAve - Soccer Live Scores CMS

FutAve is a soccer live scores platform powered by Payload CMS that provides real-time match data, league information, team statistics, and intelligent match discovery through the Wave Detector algorithm.

## Overview

This repository contains the backend and content management system (CMS) for FutAve. It integrates with the Sportmonks API to sync soccer data and provides a robust API for multiple frontend clients.

### Key Features

- **Wave Detector Algorithm** - 6-factor excitement scoring for intelligent match discovery
- **Smart Match Sorting** - Combines league priority with wave scores for optimal UX
- **Real-time match data and live scores** with comprehensive lineup information
- **Dynamic league standings** calculated from match results with performance caching
- **Sidelined players tracking** including injury details and expected return dates
- **Comprehensive player profiles** with career history, transfer details, and achievements
- **League and tournament information** with detailed statistics and standings
- **Team statistics and squad management** with formation and tactical data
- **Automated data synchronization** with Sportmonks API and wave score calculation
- **RESTful API endpoints** optimized for multiple frontend clients
- **Robust job queue system** for reliable data processing

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js with Payload CMS
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Storage**: Payload Cloud
- **API Integration**: Sportmonks Soccer API
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Collections

The CMS is structured around the following main collections:

- **Leagues** - Soccer leagues and competitions with cached standings
- **Matches** - Live and historical match data with Wave Detector scoring
- **Teams** - Team information, statistics, and standings
- **Players** - Player information and statistics
- **Coaches** - Coach information
- **Countries** - Country information for teams and leagues
- **Rivals** - Team rivalry data for enhanced wave calculations
- **MetadataTypes** - Supporting metadata for other collections
- **Media** - Images and media assets
- **Users** - CMS user management

## Data Synchronization

The system includes automated jobs for:
- Syncing league data with priority configuration
- Updating match information with Wave Detector scoring
- Calculating dynamic league standings with caching
- Maintaining team statistics and standings
- Syncing player information
- Syncing coach information
- Updating country data and rivalry information
- Managing metadata types

## API Endpoints

The CMS exposes RESTful endpoints for:
- **Smart match discovery** with Wave Detector integration (`/api/v1/matches`)
- **Wave-specific endpoints** for excitement-based filtering (`/api/v1/matches/waves`)
- Retrieving live match data with intelligent sorting
- Accessing league information with dynamic standings
- Fetching team statistics and standings
- Accessing player information
- Managing media assets
Additionally, there are specific endpoints for managing data synchronization queues (e.g., `/api/queue-jobs/sync`, `/api/queue-jobs/preview`) and a versioned API (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) for broader data access.

## Environment Variables

Before running the application, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following required variables:

```env
# Required
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/futave
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-payload-secret-key-here
SPORTMONKS_API_KEY=your-sportmonks-api-key-here

# Optional (handled automatically by Next.js/deployment platforms)
NEXT_RUNTIME=nodejs
CI=false
FORCE_AUTH=true
```

### Variable Descriptions

- `DATABASE_URI` - MongoDB connection string. For local development with Docker: `mongodb://mongo:27017/futave`
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET` - A secure secret key for Payload CMS authentication and encryption
- `SPORTMONKS_API_KEY` - Your API key from [Sportmonks](https://sportmonks.com/) for fetching soccer data
- `NEXT_RUNTIME` - Next.js runtime environment (automatically set by Next.js)
- `CI` - Continuous Integration flag (automatically set by CI/CD platforms)
- `FORCE_AUTH` - Set to `true` to test API key authentication in development mode

## API Authentication

The API endpoints under `/api/v1/` require API key authentication in production.

### Setting up API Keys

1. **Access the admin panel**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin` (or your deployment URL)
2. **Create or edit a user**: Go to the Users collection
3. **Enable API Key**: Check the "Enable API Key" option in the user form
4. **Copy the generated key**: Payload will generate a unique API key for that user

### Using API Keys

Include the API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: API-Key your-generated-key-here" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/v1/leagues
```

### Development vs Production

- **Development mode**: API key authentication is bypassed by default (when `NODE_ENV=development`)
- **Test authentication locally**: Set `FORCE_AUTH=true` in your `.env` file to test API key authentication in development
- **Production**: API key authentication is always enforced

## Context Bundles for AI Development

This project uses context bundles for AI-assisted development with Claude Code. These bundles help manage token limits and focus AI context on relevant code sections.

### Available Bundles

- **@collections** - Database schemas and Payload configuration
  - `src/collections/**/*.ts`
  - `src/payload.config.ts`

- **@api-endpoints** - API routes and handlers
  - `src/app/api/**/*.ts`

- **@sync-system** - Data synchronization services and task handlers
  - `src/services/sync/**/*.ts`
  - `src/tasks/handlers/**/*.ts`

- **@sportmonks-integration** - External API client and transformers
  - `src/services/sportmonks/**/*.ts`

- **@config** - Build and tooling configuration
  - `next.config.mjs`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `package.json`

### Usage

Reference bundles in Claude Code conversations to load relevant context:

```
@collections - "Show me the matches collection schema"
@api-endpoints - "What endpoints handle team data?"
@sync-system - "How does the player sync work?"
@sportmonks-integration - "Show me the Sportmonks transformers"
@config - "What's our TypeScript configuration?"
```

## Development

This backend system is designed to support multiple frontend clients (React Native, Next.js, etc.) while maintaining a single source of truth for soccer data.
