PRD: Wave Detector Feature for FutAve Live Scores Platform

## Overview
The Wave Detector is an algorithmic system that identifies high-significance soccer matches by analyzing multiple data points including rivalries, league standings, team form, and historical matchups. It assigns a "wave score" (0-100) to each match, helping users discover the most exciting games to watch.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Wave Score Calculation Engine
- Calculate pre-match significance scores for all matches
- Score range: 0-100 with tier classifications (S/A/B/C)
- Factor in: rivalry status, league position proximity, relegation/promotion battles, recent form, head-to-head history, and timing
- Store scores with matches for fast retrieval

### 2. Data Integration
- Leverage existing rivals collection with H2H data
- Use team standings data from team.standings
- Utilize team form calculations from team overview API
- No additional external API syncs required

### 3. API Endpoints
- GET /api/v1/matches/waves - List matches sorted by wave score
- Support filtering by date, league, minimum score
- Include wave score in match detail responses
- Provide score breakdown for transparency

### 4. Performance Requirements
- Wave score calculation < 100ms per match
- Batch calculate during match sync (not on-demand)
- Cache scores for 6 hours
- Recalculate when standings change significantly

### 5. Score Factors
- Rivalry: 0-30 points (from rivals collection)
- Position Proximity: 0-20 points (standings gap)
- Zone Importance: 0-20 points (title/relegation)
- Form Differential: 0-15 points (recent results)
- H2H Drama: 0-10 points (historical competitiveness)
- Timing: 0-5 points (late season bonus)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- Add wave_score field group to Matches collection
- Include: total score, tier, factor breakdown, timestamps
- No new collections needed

### Sync Integration
- Calculate scores during match sync
- Only for matches in next 14 days
- Skip calculation for past matches

### Caching Strategy
- Store calculated scores in match documents
- Expire after match start time
- Recalculate every 6 hours for future matches

## Success Criteria
- 95% of upcoming matches have wave scores
- Users can easily find high-significance matches
- Scores accurately reflect match importance
- System performs within latency requirements

## Future Enhancements
- Live match wave adjustments based on in-game events
- Machine learning to improve scoring accuracy
- Historical analysis of score vs actual match excitement
- Push notifications for high-wave matches

## Dependencies
- Rivals sync with H2H data (completed)
- Team standings in database (exists)
- Team form calculations (exists)
- Match sync process (exists)
